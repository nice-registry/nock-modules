When I define mocks I want to use URL\nparams in the URL instead of writing regexp's or manually creating functions\nthat do the path validation. So in modules uses the `routable` module to\nconstructor a route with params, then returns a function that validates if\nreceived URL is accepted by `routable`. If there are params defined and we have\nvalidators for it, we will execute those so you can still deny specific paths.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save nock-knock\n```\n\nWho's there?\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the module, give it an URL and pass it in the nock methods:\n\n```js\nimport route from 'nock-knock';\nimport nock from 'nock';\n\nnock('https://example.com')\n.get(route('/url/:param/another'))\n.reply(200, 'another');\n```\n\nIf you want to validate params you can supply an object as second argument. The\nkeys in the object should match the name of the param:\n\n```js\nnock('https://example.com')\n.get(route('/url/:foo/bar', {\n  foo: function validate(value) {\n    return value === 'bar'\n  }\n}))\n\n// Intercepts /url/bar/bar\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2016-12-20T14:21:43.252Z","modified":"2016-12-20T14:21:43.252Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"owners":[{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nock-knock","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nock-knock-1.0.0.tgz_1482243702652_0.6713266493752599"},"_npmUser":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"1-8056b6de5de9d9f7fb889cab2e66bede","_shasum":"2aedaeff1ba49bfdebd4e193b172da243c2ad432","author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/destinythegame/nock-knock/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"2aedaeff1ba49bfdebd4e193b172da243c2ad432","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/nock-knock/-/nock-knock-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-20T14:21:43.252Z","created":"2016-12-20T14:21:43.252Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-20T14:21:43.252Z"}}}
