If you are using a different environment, run our tests to ensure that it works as intended for you.\n\n```\ncd node_modules/generator-oss-component\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Use With Yeoman\n\n```\nmkdir myNewOssComponent\ncd myNewOssComponent\ngit init\ngit push origin master\n\n//... link it with travis... using travis-ci.org\n//... create your sauce lab user\n//... create your floobits workspace\n//... configure codeclimate\n//... setup your badges\n// and then run... (so it generates the travis keys for you)\n\nyo oss-component\n\n//... answer questions and wait for it to finish\n\n//... if you want to autopublish your module (https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation)\ntravis setup npm\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe highly encourage you to fork this repo, make enhancements, and then submit pull requests back!\n\nWhen contributing:\n\n1.
