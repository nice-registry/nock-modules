Use it for your own project's\nhelpers / initialization.\n\nExports the following globals:\n- expect (chai.expect with sinonChai)\n- request (chai.request from chai-http)\n- sinon\n- fail (helper for expect.fail)\n- fakeTime (helper for sinon.useFakeTimers)\n- HttpRecording (helper for nock)\n\n### fail\nTakes an argument of type Error and fails with the error's message\n\n### fakeTime\nIt's a function with two arguments:\n  - options: passed to `sinon.useFakeTimers` (it's optional)\n  - fn: the function that will be executed with the fake time. It can receive\n    two optional arguments, `done` (a function to call when async operations\n    finished), and `clock` (the `sinon.useFakeTimers` return object).\n\n### HttpRecording\nIt simplifies recording/playing nock cassettes.\nIf you are using it you should `HttpRecording.start()` before each test and\n`HttpRecording.stop()` after each.\n\nYour http calls should be wrapped in `HttpRecording.recordOrPlayback()` method.\nIt receives two arguments, first the cassette name (it should be located on\n`test/cassettes`), and a function (which receives a `done` function parameter to\ncall when finished).\n\nYou can change nock's mode to 'record' or 'lockdown' using the `RECORD`\nenvironment variable.\n","created":"2016-08-25T16:09:51.882Z","modified":"2016-11-17T14:30:58.500Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"warseph","email":"erabinovich@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"warseph","email":"erabinovich@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"co-test-helpers","_nodeVersion":"4.6.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/co-test-helpers-1.3.0.tgz_1479393056319_0.6858410048298538"},"_npmUser":{"name":"warseph","email":"erabinovich@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.9","_rev":"2-9b90ead26f8d5a635e6a08d7e88c3c23","_shasum":"e3bb7dbf4ef6614638ed2e86e0b469d78033c54b","author":{"name":"Ezequiel Rabinovich","email":"erabinovich@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/comparaonline/co-test-helpers/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e3bb7dbf4ef6614638ed2e86e0b469d78033c54b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/co-test-helpers/-/co-test-helpers-1.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"warseph","email":"erabinovich@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-17T14:30:58.500Z","created":"2016-08-25T16:09:51.882Z","1.0.0":"2016-08-25T16:09:51.882Z","1.0.1":"2016-08-25T18:23:08.808Z","1.1.0":"2016-08-25T21:16:57.926Z","1.1.1":"2016-08-25T21:38:01.178Z","1.1.2":"2016-08-26T15:47:53.516Z","1.2.0":"2016-08-30T19:55:21.875Z","1.3.0":"2016-11-17T14:30:58.500Z"}}}
