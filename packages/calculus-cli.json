To propogate the adoption of DevSecOps amongst all Serverless applications you are developing.\n2. As a NodeJS developer I want to use the same tooling I'm accustomed to when writing non-serverless applications (ex. Webpack, FlowType, Mocha, etc.).\n3. I want to automate the development of CI/CD pipelines for each and every Lambda function I write.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Git installed\n- Terraform installed\n- Unix based systems\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install -g calculus\n```\n_You will want to run above command as root user (sudo)._\n\n## Configuration\n\n```\ncalculus configure\n```\n\n## How to start using?\n\n#### I. Generate a Nodejs Lambda function\n\n<!-- Code snippet title -->\n```\n$ calculus create hello-world\n$ cd ./hello-world\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n#### II. Deploy your new Lambda function\n```\n$ cd ./hello-world\n$ calculus deploy\n```\n\n## FAQs\ncoming soon...\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see `LICENSE.md` for more information.\n","created":"2017-07-22T15:51:06.141Z","modified":"2017-08-19T16:52:37.351Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kassabian","email":"mike.iglesias11@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kassabian","email":"mike.iglesias11@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"calculus-cli","_nodeVersion":"6.1.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/calculus-cli-1.0.11.tgz_1503161557045_0.9064108743332326"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kassabian","email":"mike.iglesias11@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"12-58d4c04f1f355df31a619a6418852012","_shasum":"a9b4a58e7d648737b3c58bca74c607a0b8946b65","author":{"name":"Michael Iglesias","url":"Mike.Iglesias11@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Lionshead-io/calculus-serverless-cli/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.11"},"dist":{"shasum":"a9b4a58e7d648737b3c58bca74c607a0b8946b65","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/calculus-cli/-/calculus-cli-1.0.11.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kassabian","email":"mike.iglesias11@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-19T16:52:37.351Z","created":"2017-07-22T15:51:06.141Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-22T15:51:06.141Z","1.0.1":"2017-07-22T15:56:32.858Z","1.0.2":"2017-07-23T15:42:20.191Z","1.0.3":"2017-07-23T18:24:33.667Z","1.0.4":"2017-07-29T15:59:51.017Z","1.0.5":"2017-07-29T16:10:08.654Z","1.0.6":"2017-07-30T16:45:16.349Z","1.0.7":"2017-07-30T19:05:28.262Z","1.0.8":"2017-08-12T16:24:31.987Z","1.0.9":"2017-08-12T20:01:38.162Z","1.0.10":"2017-08-13T02:28:34.959Z","1.0.11":"2017-08-19T16:52:37.351Z"}}}
