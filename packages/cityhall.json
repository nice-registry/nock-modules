As such, there is really only one\n command to be familiar with:\n\n ```javascript\n startUp = function (err, data) {\n    console.log(data.value);\n };\n\n var settings = require('cityhall')('http://path.to.server/api');\n settings.getVal('/test/val1', startUp);\n```\n\nYou can also get multiple values, and in multiple ways, at once using:\n```javascript\nsettings.getVal(\n    {\n        value1: {path: '/test/val1'},\n        value2: {path: '/test/val2', environment: 'dev'},\n        value3: {path: '/test/val3', override: 'cityhall'}\n    },\n    startUp);\n```\n\n","created":"2015-12-14T22:56:58.410Z","modified":"2015-12-18T22:18:39.263Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"alexpopa","email":"alex.popa@digitalboderlands.com"},"owners":[{"name":"alexpopa","email":"alex.popa@digitalboderlands.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cityhall","_nodeVersion":"0.12.3","_npmUser":{"name":"alexpopa","email":"alex.popa@digitalboderlands.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-3f6c310ba42273d5d75f073df1ab781a","_shasum":"9b51cd53e98df6a06c967df81ab8b074b6c02b8d","author":{"name":"Alex Popa","email":"alex.popa@digitalborderlands.com","url":"http://digitalborderlands.com/cityhall"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/f00f-nyc/cityhall-npm/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"9b51cd53e98df6a06c967df81ab8b074b6c02b8d","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cityhall/-/cityhall-0.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"alexpopa","email":"alex.popa@digitalboderlands.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-18T22:18:39.263Z","created":"2015-12-14T22:56:58.410Z","0.1.0":"2015-12-14T22:56:58.410Z","0.1.1":"2015-12-18T22:18:39.263Z"}}}
