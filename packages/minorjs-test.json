version](https://badge.fury.io/js/minorjs-test.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/minorjs-test)\n\nFunctional testing framework for the [MinorJS web framework](https://github.com/skytap/minorjs).\n\n# Installation\n\nThis package is available on npm as:\n\n```\nnpm install minorjs-test\n```\n\n# Features\n\n* Makes requests to your site with a fast, headless browser.\n* Automatically starts and shuts down your HTTP server.\n* Uses jQuery-style selectors to access data in the DOM.\n* Build your tests with standard tools like Mocha and Should.\n\n# MinorJS web framework\n\nMinorJS Test is purpose-built to test [MinorJS web applications](https://github.com/skytap/minorjs).\nMinorJS is a clustered web framework for Node.js that favors convention over configuration.\n\n# CoffeeScript-friendly\n\nWhile MinorJS Test is written in Javascript, the testing framework happily works with CoffeeScript.\n\n# License\n\nCopyright 2014 Skytap Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache
