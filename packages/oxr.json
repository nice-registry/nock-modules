A map of query string parameters to pass to the http call.  \n**@params options** *(optional)*- An object to merge with the http options sent to the remote API.  \n**@returns** - A promise with the latest rates from openexchangerates.org if resolved, reject with an Instance if the remote API returns an error response or with a standard Error otherwise.\n\n### historical(date, query, options)  \n**@params date** - Date object or a String which would result in a valid Date object if called with the Date constructor.  \n**@params query** *(optional)* - A map of query string parameters to pass to the http call.  \n**@params options** *(optional)* - An object to merge with the http options sent to the remote API.  \n**@returns** - A promise with the rates at the requested date from openexchangerates.org if resolved, reject with an Instance if the remote API returns an error response or with a standard Error otherwise.\n\n### currencies(query, options)  \n**@params query** *(optional)* - A map of query string parameters to pass to the http call.  \n**@params options** *(optional)* - An object to merge with the http options sent to the remote API.  \n**@returns** - A promise with the list of currency codes from openexchangerates.org if resolved, reject with an Instance if the remote API returns an error response or with a standard Error otherwise.\n\n## Cache\n\nYou can also decorate your service with a cache.  \nIt must implement a **get** and a **put** functions which return Promises.\n\n ```javascript\nvar oxr = require('oxr')\nvar service = oxr.factory({\n  appId: process.env.OXR_APP_ID || '<YOUR_APP_ID>'\n})\n\nservice = oxr.cache({\n  store: {\n    get: function () {\n      return Promise.resolve(this.value)\n    },\n    put: function (value) {\n      this.value = value\n      return Promise.resolve(this.value)\n    }\n  },\n  ttl: 7 * 24 * 1000 * 3600\n}, service)\n```\n\nIf the timestamp of the cached rates plus its time to live (ttl) in ms is higher than the current timestamp, the service will call the remote api, otherwise, it will take the value from the cache.  \n**Note:** If an error is returned from the remote API, the service will fallback to the cached value if any, even if the cache has expired.\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf the remote service returns an error, Promises are rejected with an instance of OxrError.\n\n```javascript\nvar oxr = require('oxr')\nvar service = oxr.factory({\n  appId: '<WRONG_APP_ID>'\n})\n\nservice.latest().catch(function (error) {\n  assert(error instanceof oxr.OxrError)\n  assert.equal(error.status, 401)\n  assert.equal(error.message, 'invalid_app_id')\n  assert.equal(error.description, 'Invalid App ID provided - please sign up at https://openexchangerates.org/signup, or contact support@openexchangerates.org. Thanks!')\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n\n## License\n\nThis module is distributed under the MIT license.\n\n> Copyright (C) 2014 Laurent Renard.\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\n> obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\n> (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\n> including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\n> publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\n> and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n> subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\n> included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\n> MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\n> NONINFRINGEMENT.
