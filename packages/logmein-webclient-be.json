Failure to do so makes your application more vulnerable to the [confused deputy problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem).\n\nThis module provides with the `validateToken` method that can be used as follows:\n\n```javascript\nclient.validateToken(access_token,\n            function(r) {\n               // Save the access token in the session\n               session.access_token = access_token;\n               response.writeHead(200);\n               response.end();\n            },\n            function(r) {\n              // Return a token expired/invalid error\n              response.writeHead(498);\n              response.end();\n            },\n            function(e) {\n              // An error happened\n              response.writeHead(500);\n              response.end(e);\n            }\n        );   \n```\n\nAccessing resource owner's data\n------------\n\nOnce the client has been granted access to the resource owner's resources and the token has been validated, it can access it by means of the `getResource()` method.\n\nAs a way of example, here's the JavaScript code in the browser to access the resource owner's profile data:\n\n```javascript\nclient.getResource(session.access_token, \"/profile\", undefined,\n    function(r) {\n        r.on('data', function(chunk) {\n            profile = JSON.parse(chunk);\n    },\n    function(e) {\n       // An error happened\n    }\n);\n\n","created":"2014-09-30T03:23:51.825Z","modified":"2014-09-30T03:40:04.750Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"activems","email":"info@actisec.com"},"owners":[{"name":"activems","email":"info@actisec.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"logmein-webclient-be","_npmUser":{"name":"activems","email":"info@actisec.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.26","_rev":"1-a34acdd57eb8580dca5c85623f823b56","author":{"name":"activems"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/activems/logmein-webclient-be/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.15"},"dist":{"shasum":"c9098ab1cc4bcd2bbad96bfeb2508b958668f468","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/logmein-webclient-be/-/logmein-webclient-be-0.1.15.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"activems","email":"info@actisec.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-09-30T03:40:04.750Z","created":"2014-09-30T03:23:51.825Z","0.1.12":"2014-09-30T03:23:51.825Z","0.1.13":"2014-09-30T03:25:45.380Z","0.1.15":"2014-09-30T03:40:04.750Z"}}}
