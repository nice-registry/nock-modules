Satoshi TV needs access to both the remote procedure call (RPC) and peer-to-peer (P2P) interfaces of bitcoind, the Bitcoin Core \"daemon\". Create a file named bitcoin.conf in the Bitcoin Core data directory (by default \"~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\" on Mac OS X or \"~/.bitcoin\" on Linux) with contents:\n\n```\nrpcuser=username\nrpcpassword=password\ntxindex=1\nport=8333\nrpcport=8332\n```\n\nThe \"rpc\" properties activate the remote procedure call (RPC) interface. The \"txindex=1\" property tells it to maintain an index of all transactions by address.\n\nNow start Bitcoin Core by either running the desktop UI \"Bitcoin-QT\", or by firing up the headless daemon bitcoind.\n\nSatoshi TV is powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and its package manager npm. To install Satoshi TV and its dependencies, in a terminal shell do:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/carnesen/satoshi-tv\ncd satoshi-tv\nnpm install\n```\n\nSatoshi TV reads its configuration from [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files in the \"config\" directory. To override [the defaults](https://github.com/carnesen/satoshi-tv/tree/master/config/default.yml), create a file \"local.yml\" in that directory. \n\nNow to start Satoshi TV, do:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nFirst that [browserify](http://browserify.org/)'s the [Satoshi TV React app](https://github.com/carnesen/satoshi-tv/blob/master/app/index.js) into the [public directory]. Then it starts up the Node.js back end, which serves the public static assets as well as the JSON API. If everything went according to plan, you should now be able to connect to Satoshi TV at http://localhost:20832.\n\nHTTP API\n--------\n\nThe Satoshi TV API is served under the URI /api. A GET request to any of the endpoints returns a JSON list of timestamped data points of the form:\n```\n{\n  key: <timestamp>,\n  value: <value>\n}\n```\nwhere ```<timestamp>``` is the number of milliseconds since January 1 1970 that the data point was captured and ```<value>``` is the data value payload. You can limit the date range of data returned in the list using query parameters ```gt``` and ```lt```. For example:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:20832/api/bitcoin/transactions?gt=1434305100025\n```\nreturns transactions relayed to Satoshi TV by its Bitcoin Core peer after June 14th 2015 at 12:17PM.\n\nAPI documentation is in progress. For now you can see which endpoints are available by looking at the Javascript files in the [/lib](https://github.com/carnesen/satoshi-tv/tree/master/lib) subdirectories bitcoin, bitcoind, satoshi-tv, and system.\n\nWebSocket API\n-------------\n\nEach of the HTTP endpoints is also exposed as a WebSocket [\"namespace\"](http://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/) that on connection emits the latest data point all updates then thereafter.\n","created":"2015-06-30T23:46:49.840Z","modified":"2015-07-01T00:15:58.887Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"carnesen","email":"chris.arnesen@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"carnesen","email":"chris.arnesen@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"satoshi-tv","_nodeVersion":"0.12.3","_npmUser":{"name":"carnesen","email":"chris.arnesen@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.9.1","_rev":"1-2df47852238b7b7f0d23538c9054983a","_shasum":"46c51fc07ef2aa6092881bd18abfcddf97fd0a86","author":{"name":"Chris Arnesen","email":"chris.arnesen@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/carnesen/satoshi-tv/issues"},"directories":{"bin":"./bin","lib":"./lib"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"46c51fc07ef2aa6092881bd18abfcddf97fd0a86","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/satoshi-tv/-/satoshi-tv-0.1.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"carnesen","email":"chris.arnesen@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-07-01T00:15:58.887Z","created":"2015-06-30T23:46:49.840Z","0.0.1":"2015-06-30T23:46:49.840Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-30T23:57:09.389Z","0.1.1":"2015-07-01T00:05:33.239Z","0.1.2":"2015-07-01T00:13:02.245Z","0.1.3":"2015-07-01T00:15:58.887Z"}}}
